# Volunteer Line

This Laravel application acts as a router for phone calls to individual volunteers' phones.

The goal of the application is to make it easier for "grass roots" volunteer campaigns to connect people in need with volunteers. By acting as a call forwarder, members of the community could call a single number and automatically be connected to one of the currently-active volunteers.

For example, a "Get out the Vote" group could sign-up volunteers to drive members of the community to the polls on Election Day. A rider would only need to call a single number, and the application will connect them with the next available volunteer.
